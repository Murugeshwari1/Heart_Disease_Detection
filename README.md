This project focuses on the creation of a robust AI application for predicting heart disease using various health parameters. The aim is to provide an accurate and user-friendly diagnostic tool that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze patient data and predict the presence of heart disease.

The application utilizes a CNN model trained on a comprehensive dataset of health parameters, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.


**Key Features of the Application Include**


**High Accuracy:** The CNN model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting heart disease, providing reliable diagnostic insights.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Developed using Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive interface where users can input their health parameters and receive immediate predictions.

**Model Integration:** The trained model is seamlessly integrated into the frontend, ensuring efficient and effective predictions.

**Visualization:** The application includes visual aids such as charts and graphs to help users understand the modelâ€™s predictions and the importance of different health parameters.

**Compliance and Security:** Ensuring patient data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations is a critical component of the application.

This project highlights the potential of AI in transforming healthcare diagnostics by providing an accessible, accurate, and efficient tool for heart disease prediction. The successful implementation of this application underscores the capability of AI to enhance medical diagnostics and contribute to better patient outcomes.
